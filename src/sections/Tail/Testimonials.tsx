I genuinely felt how important it is to engage with someone who seeks to understand you and assist in your self-discovery. I had always sought solutions from the external world or other people, often neglecting to focus on myself. Although the number of sessions was limited, they played a significant role in helping me understand who I am and the goals I intend to achieve.",

However, for me, they occurred at a time when I was feeling lost and depressed, in need of a genuine push. Thanks to God and, indeed, thanks to you, I persisted with them, and I became someone who explores their inner self.",
